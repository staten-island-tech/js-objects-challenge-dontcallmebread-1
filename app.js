  //Challenge Questions
  //1) Filter all presidents, leaving only the Democratic ones
   const Dems = presidents.filter(president => president.party === "D");
  //2)Filter all presidents to leave only one term Republican presidents HINT use If statement
   
  //3) return only the last three presidents
   
  //4) log all dems who served 2 terms. HINT use chain filter, filter and slice
   
  //BONUS write a script to check if LBJ was a 2 term president. IF he was then alert("LBJ served two terms") else alert "LBJ was one and done"
